The time series included in this repository is related to the electricity consumption in Spain from 1 January 2007 at 00:00 to 21 June 2016 at 23:50. It is a time series of 9 years and 6 months with a high sampling frequency (10 minutes), resulting in 497,832 measures in total.

The time series was processed creating a window of 144 lagged values corresponding to one day and a horizon of 24 values corresponding to 4 hours. Thus, the past day is used to predict the next 4 hours. After the preprocessing, we have removed the first 144 rows and the last 24 rows, in order to avoid empty values in the instances.
